# Deployment Fix Notice

This file was created to trigger a new deployment to GitHub Pages to fix the base path issue.

The previous deployment may have been using an outdated configuration. This commit should force a rebuild with the correct base path configuration.

## What Was Fixed

1. **Base Path Configuration**: Ensured vite.config.js has the correct base path
2. **Asset References**: Verified that built assets use the correct paths
3. **Deployment Trigger**: This commit will trigger a new GitHub Actions workflow

## Verification Steps

After deployment completes:
1. Check that https://viraj3708.github.io/student-management-app/ loads correctly
2. Verify that JavaScript assets load without 404 errors
3. Confirm that the login screen appears properly

## Expected Timeline

The deployment should complete within 2-5 minutes after this commit is pushed.
