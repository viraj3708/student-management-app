# GITHUB PAGES SETUP INSTRUCTIONS

## CRITICAL: This step MUST be completed by the repository owner

The GitHub Actions deployment is failing because GitHub Pages has not been enabled.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Access Repository Settings
1. Go to: https://github.com/viraj3708/student-management-app
2. Click on the "Settings" tab (located near the top right of the repository page)

### Step 2: Find Pages Settings
1. In the left sidebar, scroll down until you see "Pages" (near the bottom of the list)
2. Click on "Pages"

### Step 3: Configure GitHub Pages
1. Under "Build and deployment" section:
   - Look for "Source" dropdown/menu
   - Select "GitHub Actions" from the options
2. Click the "Save" button

### Step 4: Verify Configuration
1. After clicking "Save", you should see:
   - A confirmation message
   - The source should now show "GitHub Actions"
   - A note about the site being available at https://viraj3708.github.io/student-management-app/

## What Happens Next

Once you complete these steps:
1. The existing GitHub Actions workflow will automatically run
2. Your site will be deployed to https://viraj3708.github.io/student-management-app/
3. The deployment should complete within 2-5 minutes

## Troubleshooting

If you still see errors after completing these steps:
1. Wait 5-10 minutes and check again
2. Make a small change to any file and push it to trigger a new workflow
3. Check that you're logged in as the repository owner (viraj3708)
