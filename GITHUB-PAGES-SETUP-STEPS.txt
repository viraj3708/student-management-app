üö® CRITICAL: GITHUB PAGES NOT ENABLED üö®

THE REASON YOUR WEBSITE IS NOT WORKING:

GitHub Pages has not been enabled in your repository settings.

THIS IS THE ONLY REASON YOUR DEPLOYMENT IS FAILING.

‚úÖ WHAT YOU MUST DO:

1. OPEN THIS EXACT URL IN YOUR BROWSER:
   https://github.com/viraj3708/student-management-app/settings/pages

2. FIND THE "BUILD AND DEPLOYMENT" SECTION

3. SET "SOURCE" TO: GitHub Actions

4. CLICK "SAVE"

‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT NOTES:

- You MUST be logged in as viraj3708
- This is a ONE-TIME setup step
- No code changes will fix this
- The workflow is working correctly
- This is purely a settings issue

‚è± WHAT HAPPENS AFTER:

- Deployment will work automatically
- Your site will be at: https://viraj3708.github.io/student-management-app/
- No further action needed

üõë IF YOU DON'T DO THIS:

- Deployment will keep failing
- You'll see "404" errors
- Your website will not be accessible

This is not a technical issue with the code.
This is a repository configuration issue.
