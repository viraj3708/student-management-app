# GitHub Pages Deployment - Action Plan

## Current Status

⚠️ **Deployment Issue Identified**: Your GitHub Pages site is loading development assets instead of production assets.

## Immediate Actions Required

### 1. Check GitHub Actions Workflow
1. Go to your repository: https://github.com/viraj3708/student-management-app
2. Click the **Actions** tab
3. Look for the **Deploy to GitHub Pages** workflow
4. Check if the latest run:
   - ✅ Completed successfully
   - ❌ Failed with errors
   - ⏳ Is still running

### 2. Review Debug Information
In the latest workflow run, check the output of:
- **Debug - Check vite.config.js** step
- **Debug - Check dist folder** step

Look for:
- Correct base path in vite.config.js
- Proper asset references in dist/index.html

### 3. Verify Repository Settings
1. Go to **Settings** > **Pages**
2. Confirm:
   - Source is set to **GitHub Actions** (not a branch)
   - Enforce HTTPS is checked

## If Workflow Is Failing

### Common Solutions

1. **Clear Cache and Redeploy**:
   - In **Settings** > **Pages**, change source to **None** and save
   - Change source back to **GitHub Actions** and save
   - Make a small commit to trigger redeployment

2. **Check Workflow Permissions**:
   - Go to **Settings** > **Actions** > **General**
   - Under **Workflow permissions**, select **Read and write permissions**

3. **Force Rebuild**:
   ```bash
   # This will be done automatically when you make the next commit
   ```

## What We've Fixed in Code

1. ✅ **Corrected base path configuration** in vite.config.js
