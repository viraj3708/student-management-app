# GitHub Actions Troubleshooting Guide

## Current Issue

Your GitHub Pages site is still loading development assets instead of the built production assets:
- **Problem**: Site loads `/src/main.jsx` instead of built JavaScript files
- **Expected**: Site should load `/student-management-app/assets/[filename].js`

## What We've Tried

1. ✅ Verified vite.config.js has correct base path: `/student-management-app/`
2. ✅ Confirmed local builds work correctly
3. ✅ Added debugging steps to GitHub Actions workflow
4. ✅ Triggered multiple deployments to refresh cache

## Possible Causes

### 1. GitHub Actions Caching Issue
GitHub Actions might be caching an old version of your configuration.

**Solution**:
1. Go to your repository Settings
2. Click **Webhooks & Services** or **Webhooks**
3. Look for any services related to GitHub Pages
4. Try removing and re-adding GitHub Pages

### 2. Branch Configuration Issue
GitHub Pages might be configured to use a different branch.

**Solution**:
1. Go to your repository **Settings**
2. Scroll to **Pages** section
3. Ensure **Branch** is set to **main** (not gh-pages)
4. Since you're using GitHub Actions, it should be set to **GitHub Actions**

### 3. Workflow Not Running
The GitHub Actions workflow might not be triggering.

**Check**:
1. Go to **Actions** tab in your repository
2. Verify the **Deploy to GitHub Pages** workflow shows recent runs
3. Check if runs are successful or failing

## How to Diagnose Further

### 1. Check GitHub Actions Logs
1. Go to your repository: https://github.com/viraj3708/student-management-app
2. Click **Actions** tab
3. Click on the latest **Deploy to GitHub Pages** workflow
4. Expand each step and look for:
   - "Debug - Check vite.config.js" step output
   - "Debug - Check dist folder" step output

### 2. Verify Repository Settings
1. Go to **Settings** > **Pages**
2. Confirm:
   - Source is set to **GitHub Actions**
   - Custom domain is empty (unless you have one)
   - Enforce HTTPS is checked

### 3. Check Workflow Permissions
1. Go to **Settings** > **Actions** > **General**
2. Under **Workflow permissions**, ensure **Read and write permissions** is selected

## Manual Fix Steps

### Option 1: Force Rebuild
```bash
# Create a significant change
echo "Force rebuild $(date)" > REBUILD-TRIGGER.txt

# Commit and push
git add REBUILD-TRIGGER.txt
git commit -m "Force rebuild and redeploy"
git push origin main
```

### Option 2: Clear GitHub Pages Cache
1. Go to **Settings** > **Pages**
2. Change source to **None** and save
3. Change source back to **GitHub Actions** and save
4. Trigger a new deployment with a commit

### Option 3: Update Workflow Explicitly
Modify `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` to include explicit cleanup:

```yaml
- name: Clean dist folder
  run: rm -rf dist
  
- name: Build
  run: npm run build
```

## If Problems Continue

### 1. Check for Error Messages
Look for specific error messages in:
- GitHub Actions workflow logs
- Browser developer console (F12)
- Network tab for 404 errors

### 2. Verify Repository Ownership
Only the repository owner (`viraj3708`) can:
- Enable GitHub Pages
- Change repository settings
- Modify workflow permissions

### 3. Contact GitHub Support
If none of the above works:
1. Prepare details of the issue
2. Include screenshots of settings
3. Include workflow logs showing the problem

## Support Information

**Repository**: viraj3708/student-management-app
**Author**: Santosh Bansode
**Expected URL**: https://viraj3708.github.io/student-management-app/

## Next Steps

1. Check GitHub Actions workflow logs for debugging information
2. Verify repository settings match requirements
3. Try the manual fix steps above
4. Contact support if issues persist

The deployment should work correctly once these issues are resolved.
