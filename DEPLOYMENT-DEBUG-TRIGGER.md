# Deployment Debug Trigger

This file was created to trigger a new deployment with debugging information enabled in the GitHub Actions workflow.

The previous deployments may have been using cached configurations or had issues with the build process. This commit should provide more detailed information about what's happening during the build and deployment process.

## What to Expect

1. The GitHub Actions workflow will now output:
   - Contents of vite.config.js
   - Contents of the built dist/index.html file
   - Directory listing of the dist folder

2. This information will help identify why the deployment is still showing development assets

## How to Check the Debug Information

1. Go to your repository: https://github.com/viraj3708/student-management-app
2. Click on the **Actions** tab
3. Look for the latest **Deploy to GitHub Pages** workflow run
4. Click on the run to see detailed logs
5. Expand the "Debug - Check vite.config.js" and "Debug - Check dist folder" steps
