IMPORTANT: GITHUB PAGES SETUP REQUIRED

The GitHub Actions deployment is failing because GitHub Pages has not been enabled.

REPOSITORY OWNER (viraj3708) - PLEASE FOLLOW THESE STEPS:

1. GO TO: https://github.com/viraj3708/student-management-app/settings/pages

2. UNDER "BUILD AND DEPLOYMENT":
   - SELECT "GITHUB ACTIONS" AS THE SOURCE
   - CLICK "SAVE"

3. AFTER SAVING, THE DEPLOYMENT WILL WORK AUTOMATICALLY

THIS IS THE ONLY MISSING STEP PREVENTING THE APPLICATION FROM BEING DEPLOYED.

Once this is done, the site will be available at:
https://viraj3708.github.io/student-management-app/

If you have any questions, please contact Santosh Bansode.
