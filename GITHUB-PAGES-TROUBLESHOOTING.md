# GitHub Pages Deployment Troubleshooting Guide

## Current Status

✅ **Site Verification**: Your site is accessible at https://viraj3708.github.io/student-management-app/
✅ **Build Process**: Local builds are successful
✅ **Workflow Configuration**: GitHub Actions workflow appears correct

## Common GitHub Pages Issues and Solutions

### 1. GitHub Pages Not Enabled

**Problem**: GitHub Pages may not be enabled in your repository settings.

**Solution**:
1. Go to your repository: https://github.com/viraj3708/student-management-app
2. Click **Settings** (gear icon) in the top navigation
3. In the left sidebar, scroll down and click **Pages**
4. Under **Build and deployment**:
   - Set **Source** to **GitHub Actions**
   - Click **Save**

### 2. Incorrect Base Path Configuration

**Problem**: The base path in `vite.config.js` might not match your repository name.

**Current Configuration**:
```javascript
base: '/student-management-app/'
```

**Verification**:
- Repository name: `student-management-app`
- Base path: `/student-management-app/` ✅ Correct

### 3. Workflow Permission Issues

**Problem**: The workflow might lack necessary permissions.

**Current Configuration**:
```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write
```

This configuration is correct ✅

### 4. Branch Configuration Issues

**Problem**: GitHub Pages might be configured to use the wrong branch.

**Solution**:
1. In your repository **Settings** > **Pages**
2. Ensure **GitHub Actions** is selected as the source (not a specific branch)

## How to Diagnose Issues

### Check GitHub Actions Workflow Status

1. Go to your repository: https://github.com/viraj3708/student-management-app
2. Click the **Actions** tab
3. Look for **Deploy to GitHub Pages** workflow
4. Check if recent runs show:
   - ✅ **Success** (green) - Deployment successful
   - ❌ **Failure** (red) - Click to see error details
   - ⏳ **In progress** (yellow) - Still deploying

### Check Deployment Status

1. Go to your repository: https://github.com/viraj3708/student-management-app
2. Click **Settings** > **Pages**
3. Look for deployment information:
   - "Your site is published at https://viraj3708.github.io/student-management-app/"
   - Last deployed: [timestamp]

## Manual Verification Steps

### 1. Verify Repository Settings

1. Repository must be **Public** (not Private)
2. GitHub Pages must be enabled with **GitHub Actions** as source
3. User `viraj3708` must be the repository owner

### 2. Check Workflow Permissions

In your repository settings:
1. Go to **Settings** > **Actions** > **General**
2. Under **Workflow permissions**, ensure **Read and write permissions** is selected

### 3. Verify Build Artifacts

The workflow should create and upload artifacts:
- Build output should be in the `dist` folder
- Artifacts should be uploaded to GitHub Pages

## If Issues Persist

### 1. Trigger a New Deployment

Make a small change to trigger a new workflow:
```bash
# Make a small change
echo "# Trigger deployment" >> README.md

# Commit and push
git add README.md
git commit -m "Trigger deployment"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Check for Error Details

1. Go to **Actions** tab
2. Click on the failed workflow run
3. Expand each step to see detailed error messages
4. Look for specific error codes or messages

### 3. Verify Repository Ownership

Only the repository owner (`viraj3708`) can enable GitHub Pages. If you're not the owner:
1. Contact `viraj3708` to enable GitHub Pages
2. Or request admin access to the repository
