FINAL GITHUB PAGES SETUP INSTRUCTIONS

=====================================

THE REASON YOUR WEBSITE IS NOT WORKING:

GitHub Pages has NOT been enabled in your repository settings.

THIS IS THE ONLY REASON YOUR DEPLOYMENT IS FAILING.

=====================================

CRITICAL STEP - MUST BE DONE BY REPOSITORY OWNER:

1. Go to this exact URL:
   https://github.com/viraj3708/student-management-app/settings/pages

2. Under "Build and deployment" section:
   - Find the "Source" setting
   - Change it from "None" to "GitHub Actions"
   - Click "Save"

=====================================

WHAT HAPPENS AFTER YOU DO THIS:

- The GitHub Actions workflow will run automatically
- Your website will be deployed
- Your site will be available at:
  https://viraj3708.github.io/student-management-app/

=====================================

WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU DON'T DO THIS:

- Deployment will continue to fail with "404" errors
- Your website will NOT be accessible
- You'll keep seeing the same error messages

=====================================

IMPORTANT NOTES:

- This is NOT a code issue
- The workflow is working correctly
- This is purely a repository settings issue
- Only the repository owner (viraj3708) can do this
- You must be logged in to GitHub as viraj3708
