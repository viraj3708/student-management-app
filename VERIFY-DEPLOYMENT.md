# GitHub Pages Deployment Verification Guide

## How to Verify Your Deployment

### Step 1: Enable GitHub Pages (MANDATORY)

1. Go to your repository on GitHub: https://github.com/viraj3708/student-management-app/settings/pages
2. Under "Build and deployment", select "GitHub Actions" as the source
3. Click "Save"
4. This step MUST be completed or the deployment will fail

### Step 2: Wait for Deployment

- GitHub Actions deployment usually takes 2-5 minutes
- Check the "Actions" tab to see workflow progress: https://github.com/viraj3708/student-management-app/actions
- Wait for the workflow to complete successfully (green checkmark)

### Step 3: Verify Deployment Success

#### Visual Check
1. Visit your site: https://viraj3708.github.io/student-management-app
2. You should see:
   - The login screen with "Student Management System" title
   - Username: admin
   - Password: admin
   - Language toggle buttons (English/Marathi)

#### Functionality Check
1. Log in with credentials (admin/admin)
2. Test these features:
   - Dashboard navigation
   - Student profile creation
   - Attendance recording
   - Health information entry
   - Marks entry
   - Result generation and PDF download

#### File Structure Check
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Verify these files exist in the main branch:
   - index.html
   - assets/ folder with CSS and JS files
   - README.md
   - DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md
   - BUILD-DEPLOY.md

### Step 4: Troubleshooting Common Issues

#### Issue 1: "Site not found" (404)
**Solution:**
- Check that GitHub Pages is enabled in repository settings
- Verify the source is set to "GitHub Actions"
- Wait a few more minutes for deployment to complete

#### Issue 2: Blank page or loading issues
**Solution:**
- Check browser console for errors (F12 → Console tab)
- Verify all assets loaded correctly (F12 → Network tab)
- Ensure the build was successful and dist folder contents were uploaded

#### Issue 3: Features not working
**Solution:**
- Check that JavaScript is enabled in your browser
- Verify browser compatibility (modern browsers recommended)
- Check console for specific error messages

#### Issue 4: GitHub Actions failing
**Solution:**
- Ensure GitHub Pages is enabled with "GitHub Actions" source
- Check that the repository owner has granted proper permissions
- Look at the specific error message in the Actions tab
